Calculation of shear resistance for HM30Cl5.8:
	γM2 = 1.250
	αν  = 0.500 - Shear plane passes through the threaded portion of the bolt
	Fub = 500.0 MPa
	As  = 561.0 mm²
	In according to table 3.4 EN1993-1-8:
	Shear resistance is 112.2 kN
Calculation of shear resistance for HM30Cl5.8:
	γM2 = 1.250
	αν  = 0.600 - Shear plane passes through the unthreaded portion of the bolt
	Fub = 500.0 MPa
	As  = 561.0 mm²
	In according to table 3.4 EN1993-1-8:
	Shear resistance is 134.6 kN
